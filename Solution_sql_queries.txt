-------------------------
A. How many customers does UtilityPlus serve?

Total 29 customers from both electricity_services & mobile_services.

select count(*) from (
select CUSTOMER_ID from electricity_services
union all
select CUSTOMER_ID from mobile_services
)

Total 13 distinct customers from both electricity_services & mobile_services on CUSTOMER_ID.

select count(*) from (
select CUSTOMER_ID from electricity_services
union
select CUSTOMER_ID from mobile_services
);

B. How many services in total does UtilityPlus provide? Can the same
sql query be used to also show a split of services by type
(mobile/electricity)?
Total 27 services
select sum(services) from (
select  count(ELECTRICITY_SERVICE_ID) as services from electricity_services
union all
select Count(MOBILE_NUMBER) as services FROM mobile_services
);

select * from (
select 'electricity_services' as Table_name, count(ELECTRICITY_SERVICE_ID) from electricity_services
union all
select 'mobile_services' as Table_name, Count(MOBILE_NUMBER) FROM mobile_services
);

C. How many customers have both Electricity and Mobile Services?

We have 9 distinct customers we have those having both Electricity and Mobile Services.
select distinct CUSTOMER_ID from electricity_services where CUSTOMER_ID in (select distinct CUSTOMER_ID from mobile_services);

We have below query as well.
select CUSTOMER_ID from electricity_services where CUSTOMER_ID in (select CUSTOMER_ID from mobile_services); --14
select CUSTOMER_ID from mobile_services where CUSTOMER_ID in (select CUSTOMER_ID from electricity_services); --11


D. Can you build a data table showing the number of Elec services
being supplied (i.e. ongoing services and not ended) at the end of each
month?

select 
extract(year from SERVICE_START_DATE) as year,
extract(month from SERVICE_START_DATE) as month, count(*) from 
electricity_services where SERVICE_END_DATE is null and ELECTRICITY_SERVICE_ID is not null 
group by year,month order by year,month;

better solution could be below:
select last_day(SERVICE_START_DATE,'MONTH') as last_day, count(*) 
from electricity_services where SERVICE_END_DATE is null and ELECTRICITY_SERVICE_ID is not null 
group by last_day order by last_day;


E. What are your observations on the nature of UtilityPlus customers
and their services based on the datasets?

Observations:
some customers who have subscription for electricity_services also have mobile_servies.
majority of customers are looking for electricity_services compared to mobile_servies.
